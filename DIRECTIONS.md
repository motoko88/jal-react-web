Directions For React (Web) App:

- Start a new project using typescript (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
- Take a look at the picture attached, and try to conceptualize the following:

What are the main parts of the page? (Think html)
What parts appear to be (reusable) components?
How does data appear to flow?
What is the overall design in terms of style? Try to incorporate what you know of CSS.

_You can draw on the picture and organize things if you want._

- Lastly, feel free to get a head start, and see how far you can get on your own, you don't have to worry about things matching 100% at the moment.
